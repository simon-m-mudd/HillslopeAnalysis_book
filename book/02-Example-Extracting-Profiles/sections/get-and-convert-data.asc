=== Get the data

The data for this example is located on https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets[GitHub]. 
You don't want to get all of this data, only the file *WhiteadderDEM.tif*. 


. In your terminal window, navigate to the folder `Example01_data`. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd Example01_data
----
+
. Grab the data using the `wget` command. `wget` is the linux way to download stuff from the internet. 
You should be aware that for big files `wget` is much faster than downloading things via a browser (e.g. chrome or firefox).
+
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/HillslopeAnalysis/Example01_data
$ wget https://github.com/LSDtopotools/ExampleTopoDatasets/raw/master/WhiteadderDEM.tif
----
+ 
. Make sure you have got the file with the `ls` command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ls
WhiteadderDEM.tif
----

==== Convert the data to ENVI bil format

The data you have grabbed is in GeoTIFF format.
http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] doesn't read this file format. 
There are good reasons for this, but they are tedious and I will not bore you with them.
We need to convert the data using http://www.gdal.org/gdal_utilities.html[GDAL utilities]. 
These are already installed on the University of Edinburgh servers. 
If you aren't using our servers, you can go to https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_book[the LSDTopoTools documentation]
for instructions on how to get them. 

. In your terminal window, you can get some information about the data using `gdalinfo`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ gdalinfo WhiteadderDEM.tif
<<A whole bunch of information>>
----
+ 
. To convert this to the ENVI format, you use `gdal_translate`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ gdal_translate -of ENVI WhiteadderDEM.tif WhiteadderDEM.bil
----
+ 
. Check to see if it has worked:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ls
WhiteadderDEM.bil          WhiteadderDEM.hdr
WhiteadderDEM.bil.aux.xml  WhiteadderDEM.tif
----
+
. Great! You now have the data in a format you can use! Lets move on to calculating curvature and slope.
