=== Extracting hillslope profiles using ArcGIS

Okay, by now you should have generated some curvature, slope and aspect datasets using http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools].
We are now going to move on to ArcMap to extract some profiles. 

. First open a blank map in ArcMap.

. The use the add data button to get the various data layers in.

. You should add the slope, curvature, planform curvature and hillshade (hs) rasters. You can play around with lookaing at these, 
but eventually you should put the planform curvature raster on top and change its colouring 
(click on the colourbar to change) so that the colour ramp has a light colour ar around 0:

. If planform curvautre is positive, you are in a valley, whereas if planform curvature is negative you are on a nose. 
When you make hillslope profiles, you want to avoid these areas.
