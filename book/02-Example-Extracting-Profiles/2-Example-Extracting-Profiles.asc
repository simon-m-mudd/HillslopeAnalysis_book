== An example: Extracting Profiles

In this example we will extract some hillslope profiles from a topographic dataset. 

We are going to use a combination of tools in the Linux environment as well as ArcGIS. 

=== First steps: open a terminal window

. Go into a linux environment (at Edinburgh, you will log on to our servers via https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/it/FAQ/x2go.html[X2Go]).

. Open a terminal window (frequently you can do this by right clicking on a linux desktop and selecting *terminal*). 
Sometimes you can also get a terminal by pressing `ctrl`+`alt`+`T` (in Ubuntu and Debian, for those of you working on a computer at home).

. Make a folder for these excercises. In linux, you make folders with the `mkdir` command. Why don't we call the folder HillslopeAnalysis:
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir HillslopeAnalysis
----
+
. Go into this folder with the `cd` command, and make two new directories: `Example01_data` and `SourceCode`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd HillslopeAnalysis
$ mkdir SourceCode
$ mkdir Example01_data
----
+
. You will need to know where these directories are located. You can find where you are in linux by typing `pwd`:
+
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
/home/HillslopeAnalysis
----
+
IMPORTANT: Your directory might not be the same as mine!! Make sure you note the location of the directory.
+
NOTE: In linux, you can always return to your home directory with the command: `cd ~`.
+
. Make sure your directories are there. You can do this using the `ls` command, which lists the files and directories in a folder:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ls
Example01_data  SourceCode
----
+
. Well done! You are now ready to get the example data.

include::sections/calculate-curvature-and-slope-rasters.asc[]

include::sections/extract-profiles.asc[]

=== Summary

You now should be able to get curvature and slope rasters from a DEM, and extract profiles from this DEM.
